## This repository contains the 5 projects required for the [FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python).

### Skills learnt:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

### Brief summary of the projects (in order of completion):
1. Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation Calculator: Practice using NumPy to calculate mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
2. Demographic Data Analyzer: Practice using Pandas to answer queries using demographics data.
3. Medical Data Visualizer: Clean data and plot using Seaborn's Catplot (to see effect of cardio on health and lifestyle factors) and Heatmap (to see correlation between health and lifestyle factors).
4. Page View Time Series Visualizer: Clean data and do line plot, bar plot, box plot using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyse page views over time.
5. Sea Level Predictor: Use SciPy's linear regression function to predict future sea levels using current data trends.
